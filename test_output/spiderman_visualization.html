        <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> is a superhero in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Stan Lee</span> and artist <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Steve Ditko</span>, he first appeared in the anthology comic book <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Amazing Fantasy #15</span> (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">August 1962</span>) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Considered <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes</span>, he has been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.[9]
Spider-Man has the secret identity of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">Peter Benjamin Parker</span> who was raised by his <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C4E9E4;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Aunt May</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Uncle Ben</span></span> in Queens, New York City after the death of his parents. Lee, Ditko, and later creators had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood and his &quot;self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness&quot; were issues to which young readers could relate.[10] Unlike previous teen heroes, Spider-Man was not a sidekick nor did he have a mentor. He would be given many supporting characters, such as his Daily Bugle boss <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">J.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Jonah Jameson</span>; friends like <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Flash Thompson</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Harry Osborn</span>; romantic interests like <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Gwen Stacy</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane Watson</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">the Black Cat</span>; and enemies such as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Doctor Octopus</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">the Green Goblin</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Venom</span>. In his origin story, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span> gets his superhuman spider powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These powers include superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes and durability; clinging to surfaces and ceilings; and detecting danger with his precognitive &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">spider-</span>sense&quot;. He sews a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">spider-web patterned spandex costume that fully covers him</span> and builds wrist-mounted &quot;web-shooter&quot; devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">fighting and &quot;web swinging&quot; across the city</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter Parker</span> initially used his powers for personal gain, but after his <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Uncle Ben</span> was killed by a burglar that he could have stopped but did not, Peter learned &quot;with great power comes great responsibility&quot; and began to use his powers to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">fight crime</span> as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>.
Marvel has featured <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> in several <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">comic book series</span>, the first and longest-lasting of which is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man</span>. Since his introduction, the main-continuity version of Peter has gone from a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">high school student to attending college to currently being somewhere in his late 20s</span>. Peter has been a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">member of numerous superhero teams, most notably the Avengers and Fantastic Four</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Doctor Octopus</span> also <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">took on the identity</span> for a story arc spanning <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">2012–2014</span> following the &quot;Dying Wish&quot; storyline, where <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span> appears to die after Doctor Octopus orchestrates a body swap with him and becomes the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Superior Spider-Man</span>.[11] Marvel has also published <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">comic books</span> featuring alternate versions of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>, including <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man 2099</span>, which features the adventures of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="41" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Miguel O&#x27;Hara</span>, the Spider-Man of the future; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="42" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Ultimate Spider-Man</span>, which features the adventures of a teenage <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="43" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter Parker</span> in the alternate universe; and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="44" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man</span>, which depicts a teenager named <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="45" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Miles Morales</span> who <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="46" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">takes up the mantle of Spider-Man</span> after <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="47" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ultimate Peter Parker</span>&#x27;s apparent death. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="48" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Miles</span> later became a superhero in his own right and was brought into mainstream continuity during the Secret Wars event, where he sometimes <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="49" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">works alongside the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="50" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">mainline version of Peter</span></span>.
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="51" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> has appeared in countless forms of media, including several <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="52" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">animated TV series</span>: the first original animated series Spider-Man, with Paul Soles voicing the titular character, a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="53" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">live-action television series</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="54" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">syndicated newspaper comic strips</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="55" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">multiple series of films</span>. Spider-Man was first portrayed in live-action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a recurring skit on The Electric Company from <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="56" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1974 to 1977</span>.[12] In live-action films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire in Sam Raimi&#x27;s Spider-Man trilogy, by Andrew Garfield in two films directed by Marc Webb,[13] and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland. Reeve Carney originally starred as Spider-Man in the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="57" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">2010</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="58" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Broadway musical</span> Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.[14] Spider-Man was also voiced by Jake Johnson and Chris Pine in the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="59" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">animated film</span> Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, with the former reprising his role in the sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.

In <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="60" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1962</span>, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="61" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Stan Lee</span> was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="62" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> arose from a surge in teenage demand for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="63" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">comic books</span>, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.[16]: 1  As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to &quot;get out of his system&quot; what he felt was missing in comic books.[17]
In his autobiography, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="64" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lee</span> cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence,[15]: 130 [18] and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.[note 1] Besides the name, the Spider was wanted by both <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="65" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">the law and the criminal underworld</span> (a defining theme of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="66" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>&#x27;s early years) and had through years of ceaseless struggle developed a &quot;sixth sense&quot;, which warns him of danger, the inspiration for Spider-Man&#x27;s &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="67" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">spider-sense</span>&quot;.[18]
Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with &quot;boy&quot;, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="68" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lee</span> says he chose &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="69" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>&quot; because he wanted the character to age as the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="70" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">series</span> progressed, and felt the name &quot;Spider-Boy&quot; would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes.[19] He also decided to insert a hyphen in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman, another superhero with a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="71" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">red and blue costume</span> that starts with an &quot;S&quot; and ends with &quot;man&quot;[20] (although artist <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="72" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Steve Ditko</span> intended the character to have an orange and purple costume).[21]
At that time, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="73" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lee</span> had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character&#x27;s approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman&#x27;s objections.[note 2]
Goodman eventually agreed to a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="74" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> tryout in what <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="75" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lee</span>, in numerous interviews, recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="76" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Amazing Adult Fantasy</span>, which was renamed <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="77" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Amazing Fantasy</span> for issue #15 (cover-dated <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="78" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">August 1962</span>, on sale <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="79" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">June 5, 1962</span>).[22] In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that Amazing Fantasy would be canceled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man.[19] While this was the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that &quot;The Spider-Man ... will appear every month in Amazing.&quot;[22][23]
Lee received Goodman&#x27;s approval for the name Spider-Man and the &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="80" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">ordinary teen</span>&quot; concept and approached artist <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="81" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Jack Kirby</span>. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="82" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="83" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Kirby</span></span> told <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="84" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lee</span> about <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="85" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">an unpublished character</span> on which he had collaborated with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="86" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Joe Simon</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="87" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">in the 1950s</span>, in which <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="88" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">an orphaned boy</span> living with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="89" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">an old couple</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="90" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers</span>. Lee and Kirby &quot;immediately sat down for a story conference&quot;, Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="91" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">draw some pages</span>.[24] <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="92" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Steve Ditko</span> would be the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="93" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">inker</span>.[note 3] When <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="94" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee</span> recalled, &quot;I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly—it just wasn&#x27;t the character I wanted; it was too heroic&quot;.[24]: 12  Lee turned to Ditko, who developed an art style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:
One of the first things I did was to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="95" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">work up <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="96" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">a costume</span></span>. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="97" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">A clinging power so he wouldn&#x27;t have hard shoes or boots</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="98" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">a hidden wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster</span>, etc. ... I wasn&#x27;t sure <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="99" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Stan</span> would like the idea of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="100" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">covering the character&#x27;s face</span> but I did it because it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="101" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">hid an obviously boyish face</span>. It would also add mystery to the character....[25]
Although the interior artwork was by <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="102" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ditko</span> alone, Lee rejected Ditko&#x27;s cover art and commissioned <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="103" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Kirby</span> to pencil a cover that Ditko inked.[22] As Lee explained in 2010, &quot;I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack&#x27;s covers.&quot;[26]

In an early recollection of the character&#x27;s creation, Ditko described his and Lee&#x27;s contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="104" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Comic Fan #2</span> (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="105" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Summer 1965</span>): &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="106" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Stan Lee</span> thought the name up. I did <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="107" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">costume, web gimmick on wrist &amp; spider signal</span>.&quot;[27] At the time, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="108" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="109" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ditko</span></span> shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="110" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> was &quot;almost nil&quot;, he and Ditko had &quot;worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="111" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Steve on his own ... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands.&quot;[24]: 14  Ditko</span> claimed in a rare interview with Jonathan Ross that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="112" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the costume was initially envisioned with an orange and purple color scheme, rather than the recognizable red and blue</span>.[28]
Kirby disputed Lee&#x27;s version of the story and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character&#x27;s creation. According to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="113" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Kirby</span>, the idea for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="114" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> had originated with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="115" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Kirby</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="116" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Joe Simon</span>, who in the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="117" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1950s</span> had developed a character called <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="118" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">the Silver Spider</span> for the Crestwood Publications comic <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="119" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Black Magic</span>, but the character was left unused.[note 4] Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputed Kirby&#x27;s account, asserting that Black Magic was not a factor and that Simon devised the name &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (later changed to &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="120" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">The Silver Spider</span>&quot;), while Kirby outlined the character&#x27;s story and powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby&#x27;s character conception became the basis for Simon&#x27;s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="121" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Archie Comics</span> superhero, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="122" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">the Fly</span>.[29] Artist <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="123" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Steve Ditko</span> stated that Lee liked the name <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="124" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Hawkman</span> from DC Comics, and that &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was an outgrowth of that interest.[25]
Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="125" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> version to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="126" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lee</span>, who liked the idea and assigned <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="127" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Kirby</span> to draw sample pages of the new character, but disliked the results—in Simon&#x27;s description, &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="128" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Captain America with cobwebs</span>&quot;.[note 5] Writer Mark Evanier notes that Lee&#x27;s reasoning that Kirby&#x27;s character was too heroic seems unlikely—Kirby still drew the covers for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="129" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Amazing Fantasy #15</span> and the first issue of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="130" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man</span>. Evanier also disputes Kirby&#x27;s given reason that he was &quot;too busy&quot; to draw Spider-Man in addition to his other duties, since Kirby was, said Evanier, &quot;always busy&quot;.[30]: 127  Neither Lee&#x27;s nor Kirby&#x27;s explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman, or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man, as drawn and envisioned by Kirby, was too similar to the Fly.[30]: 127 
Author and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="131" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ditko</span> scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly. Ditko recalled that &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="132" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Stan</span> called Jack about the Fly&quot;, adding that &quot;[d]ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan&#x27;s synopsis.&quot; It was at this point that the entire concept of the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="133" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">strip</span> went through a major overhaul. &quot;Out went the magic ring, adult <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="134" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained.&quot; Lee gave <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="135" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ditko</span> the premise of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="136" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers</span>, where Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as &quot;the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series&quot;. On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko stated, &quot;I still don&#x27;t know whose idea was Spider-Man&quot;.[31] Ditko did, however, view the published version of Spider-Man as a separate creation to the one he saw in the five pencilled pages that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="137" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Kirby</span> had completed. To support this, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="138" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ditko</span> used the analogy of the Kirby/Marvel Thor, which was based on a name or idea of a character in Norse mythology: &quot;If Marvel&#x27;s Thor is a valid created work by Jack, his creation, then why isn&#x27;t <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="139" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> by <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="140" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Stan</span> and me valid created work, our creation?&quot;[32]
Kirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="141" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ditko</span> who &quot;got Spider-Man to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did&quot;.[33] Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, had acknowledged <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="142" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ditko</span>&#x27;s role, stating, &quot;If <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="143" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="144" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [it]&quot;.[34] He has further commented that Ditko</span></span>&#x27;s costume design was key to the character&#x27;s success; since <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="145" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the costume completely covers Spider-Man&#x27;s body</span>, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus easily identify with the character.[19]

A few months after <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="146" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>&#x27;s introduction, publisher Goodman reviewed <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="147" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">the</span> sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it was <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="148" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">one of the nascent Marvel&#x27;s highest-selling comics</span>.[35]: 97  A solo ongoing series followed, beginning with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="149" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man</span> #1 (cover-dated <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="150" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">March 1963</span>). The title eventually became <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="151" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Marvel&#x27;s top-selling series</span>[10]: 211  with the character swiftly becoming a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="152" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">cultural icon</span>; a 1965 Esquire poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons. One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="153" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">beset by woes, money problems, and the question of existence. In short, he is one of us</span>.&quot;[10]: 223  Following <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="154" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Ditko</span>&#x27;s departure after issue #38 (July 1966), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="155" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">John Romita Sr.</span> replaced him as penciller and would draw the series for the next several years. In <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="156" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1968</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="157" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Romita</span> would also draw the character&#x27;s extra-length stories in the comics magazine <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="158" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Spectacular <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="159" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span></span>, a proto-graphic novel designed to appeal to older readers. It lasted for two issues and represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series&#x27; summer Annuals that began in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="160" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1964</span>.[36]
An early 1970s Spider-Man story ultimately led to the revision of the Comics Code Authority. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction of the use of illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration&#x27;s Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="161" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Stan Lee</span> to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel&#x27;s top-selling titles.[10]: 239  Lee chose the top-selling <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="162" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man</span>; issues #96–98 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="163" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">May–July 1971</span>) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="164" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter Parker</span>&#x27;s friend <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="165" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Harry Osborn</span> becomes addicted to pills. When <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="166" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="167" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">fights the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="168" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="169" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Green Goblin</span> (Norman Osborn</span>, Harry</span>&#x27;s father), Spider-Man defeats him by revealing Harry&#x27;s drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority&#x27;s approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry&#x27;s self-censorship was undercut, and the Code was subsequently revised.[10]: 239 
In <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="170" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1972</span>, a second monthly ongoing series starring Spider-Man began: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="171" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Marvel Team-Up</span>, in which Spider-Man was paired with other superheroes and supervillains.[37] From that point on, there have generally been at least two ongoing Spider-Man series at any time. In <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="172" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1976</span>, his second solo series, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="173" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Peter Parker, the Spectacular <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="174" style="background-color:#E8EAED;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="175" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="176" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span></span></span></span>, began running parallel to the main series.[38] A third series featuring <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="177" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="178" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Web of Spider-Man</span>, launched in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="179" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1985</span> to replace <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="180" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Marvel Team-Up</span>.[39] The launch of a fourth monthly title in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="181" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1990</span>, the &quot;adjectiveless&quot; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="182" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> (with the storyline &quot;Torment&quot;), written and drawn by popular artist <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="183" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Todd McFarlane</span>, debuted with several different covers, all with the same interior content. All four versions combined <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="184" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">sold over three million copies</span>, an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="185" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">industry record at the time</span>. Several miniseries, one-shot issues, and loosely related comics have also been published, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="186" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="187" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">makes frequent cameos and guest appearances in other comic book series</span>.[38][40] In <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="188" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1996</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="189" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Sensational Spider-Man</span> was created to replace Web of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="190" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>.[41]
In <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="191" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1998</span>, writer-artist <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="192" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="193" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">John Byrne</span></span> revamped the origin of Spider-Man in the 13-issue limited series <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="194" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Spider-Man: Chapter One</span> (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="195" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Dec. 1998–Oct.</span> 1999), similar to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="196" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Byrne</span>&#x27;s adding details and some revisions to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="197" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Superman</span>&#x27;s origin in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="198" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">DC Comics&#x27; The Man of Steel</span>.[42] During that time, the original <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="199" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man</span> ended with issue #441 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="200" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Nov. 1998</span>), and The Amazing Spider-Man started with volume 2, #1 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="201" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Jan. 1999</span>).[43] In 2003, Marvel reintroduced the original numbering for The Amazing Spider-Man and what would have been volume 2, #59, became issue #500 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="202" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Dec. 2003</span>).[43]
When the main series The Amazing Spider-Man reached issue #545 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="203" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Dec. 2007</span>), Marvel dropped its spin-off ongoing series and instead began publishing The Amazing Spider-Man three times monthly, beginning with #546–548 (all <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="204" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">January 2008</span>).[44] The scheduling of The Amazing Spider-Man lasted until <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="205" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">November 2010</span>, when the comic book expanded from 22 pages to 30 pages for each issue. Later on, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="206" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="207" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span></span> was published twice a month, beginning with #648–649 (both <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="208" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">November 2010</span>).[45][46] The following year, Marvel launched <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="209" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Avenging Spider-Man</span> as the first spin-off ongoing series in addition to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="210" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man</span>, since the previous ones were canceled at the end of 2007.[44] <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="211" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing series</span> temporarily ended with issue #700 in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="212" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">December 2012</span> and was replaced by <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="213" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Superior Spider-Man</span>, which had <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="214" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Doctor Octopus</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="215" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">serve as the new Spider-Man by taking over <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="216" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter Parker</span>&#x27;s body</span>. Superior was an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="217" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">enormous commercial success</span> for Marvel,[47] and ran for 31 issues before the real <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="218" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter Parker</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="219" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">returned in a newly relaunched The Amazing Spider-Man #1</span> in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="220" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">April 2014</span>.[48]
Following <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="221" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">the</span> 2015 Secret Wars crossover event, a number of Spider-Man-related titles were either relaunched or created as part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event. Among them, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="222" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="223" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span></span> was relaunched and primarily focuses on Peter Parker continuing to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="224" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">run Parker Industries</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="225" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">becomes <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="226" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">a successful businessman who is operating worldwide</span>.[49]

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="227" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">In Forest Hills, Queens, New York City</span>,[50] Midtown High School student <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="228" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Peter Benjamin Parker</span> is a science-whiz orphan living with his <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="229" style="background-color:#C4E9E4;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="230" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Uncle Ben and Aunt May</span></span>. As depicted in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="231" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Amazing Fantasy #15</span> (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="232" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Aug. 1962</span>), he is bitten by a radioactive spider (erroneously classified as an insect in the panel) at a science exhibit and &quot;acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid&quot;.[51] Along with heightened athletic abilities, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels</span>. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="233" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">dons a costume</span> and, as &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="234" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">becomes a novelty television star</span>. However, &quot;[h]e blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief, [and] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="235" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Uncle Ben</span>.&quot; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="236" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the story&#x27;s next-to-last caption, &quot;With great power there must also come—great responsibility!&quot;[52]
In the first issue of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="237" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man</span> (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="238" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">March 1963</span>), despite his superpowers, Peter struggles to help his widowed <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="239" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Aunt May</span> pay the rent, is taunted by <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="240" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Flash</span>, and continues <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="241" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">fighting crime and saving the city</span> as Spider-Man, but his heroic deeds engender the editorial wrath of newspaper publisher of the Daily Bugle, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="242" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">J. Jonah Jameson</span>, who holds a grudge against Spider-Man, and continues making false statements about Spider-Man despite his heroism. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="243" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Peter</span> gets hired as a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="244" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">freelance photographer</span> by <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="245" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mr. Jameson</span> to take pictures of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="246" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>, with him being unaware that Spider-Man is Peter Parker.[53][54] Spider-Man fights his enemies, including superpowered and non-superpowered supervillains—his archenemy and nemesis <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="247" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Green Goblin and then Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Chameleon, Lizard, Vulture, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, and Mysterio</span>, defeating them one by one[55]—but Peter finds juggling his personal and superhero life difficult. In time, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="248" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="249" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">graduates from high school</span>[56] and enrolls at Empire State University (a fictional institution evoking the real-life Columbia University and New York University),[57] where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn and girlfriend Gwen Stacy,[58] and Aunt May introduces him to Mary Jane Watson.[55][59][60] As Peter deals with Harry&#x27;s drug problems, and Harry&#x27;s father, Norman Osborn, is revealed to be the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="250" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Green Goblin,</span> Peter attempts to give up his <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="251" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">costumed identity</span> for a while.[61][62] Gwen Stacy&#x27;s father, New York City Police detective Captain George Stacy</span>, is accidentally killed during a battle between <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="252" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="253" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Doctor Octopus</span> (issue #90, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="254" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">November 1970</span>).[63]

Working through his grief, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="261" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Peter</span> eventually develops tentative feelings toward <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="262" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="263" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">the</span> two &quot;become confidants rather than lovers&quot;.[68] A romantic relationship eventually develops, with Parker proposing to her in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="264" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">issue #182</span> (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="265" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">July 1978</span>), and being turned down an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="266" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">issue</span> later.[69] Peter went on to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="267" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">graduate from college</span> in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="268" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">issue #</span>185,[55] and becomes involved with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="269" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">the</span> shy <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="270" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Debra Whitman</span> and the extroverted, flirtatious costumed thief <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="271" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Felicia Hardy, a.k.a. the Black Cat</span>,[70] whom he meets in issue #194 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="272" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">July 1979</span>).[55]
From <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="273" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1984 to 1988</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="274" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> wore a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="275" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">black costume with a white spider design on his chest</span>. The new costume originated in the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="276" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Secret Wars miniseries</span> on an alien planet where Spider-Man <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="277" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">participates in a battle between Earth&#x27;s major superheroes and supervillains</span>.[71] He continues wearing the costume when he returns, starting in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="278" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man #252</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="279" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The</span> change to a longstanding character&#x27;s design met with controversy, &quot;with many hardcore comics fans decrying it as tantamount to sacrilege. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="280" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>&#x27;s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="281" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">traditional red and blue costume</span> was iconic, they argued, on par with those of his D.C. rivals Superman and Batman.&quot;[72] The creators then revealed the costume was an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="282" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">alien symbiote</span>, which Spider-Man rejects after a difficult struggle,[73] though the symbiote returns several times as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="283" style="background-color:#EADDFF;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="284" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Venom</span></span> for revenge.[55] <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="285" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span> proposes to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="286" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane</span> in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="287" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man #290</span> (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="288" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">July 1987</span>), and she accepts two issues later, with the wedding taking place in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="289" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21</span> (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="290" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1987</span>)—promoted with a real-life mock wedding using actors at Shea Stadium, with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="291" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Stan Lee</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="292" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">officiating</span>, on <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="293" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">June 5, 1987</span>.[74] <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="294" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">David Michelinie</span>, who <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="295" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">scripted</span> based on a plot by editor-in-chief <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="296" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Jim Shooter</span>, said in 2007, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think they actually should [have gotten] married. ... I had actually planned another version, one that wasn&#x27;t used.&quot;[74] <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="297" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Peter</span> publishes a book of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="298" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> photographs called <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="299" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Webs</span>,[75] and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="300" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">returns to his Empire State University graduate studies in biochemistry</span> in #310 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="301" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Dec. 1988</span>).[55]
In the controversial[76] 1990s storyline the &quot;Clone Saga&quot;, a clone of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="302" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Parker</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="303" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">created in 1970s comics by insane scientist</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="304" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Miles Warren, a.k.a. the Jackal</span>, returns to New York City upon hearing of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="305" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Aunt May</span>&#x27;s health worsening. The clone had lived incognito as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="306" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ben Reilly</span>, but now <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="307" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">assumes the superhero guise <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="308" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">the Scarlet Spider</span></span> and allies with Parker. To the surprise of both, new tests indicate Ben is the original and Peter is the clone.[77] Complicating matters, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="309" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane</span> announces in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="310" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Spectacular Spider-Man</span> #220 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="311" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Jan.</span> 1995) that she is pregnant with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="312" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span>&#x27;s baby.[55] Later, however, a resurrected <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="313" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Norman Osborn</span> has <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="314" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane</span> poisoned, causing premature labor and the death of her and Peter&#x27;s unborn daughter.[78] It is later revealed that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="315" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">The Green Goblin</span> switched the results of the clone test in an attempt to destroy Peter&#x27;s life by making him believe himself to be the clone. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="316" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ben</span> is killed while saving Peter, in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="317" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Peter Parker: Spider-Man</span> #75 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="318" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Dec. 1996</span>), and his body immediately crumbles into dust, confirming Ben was the clone.[78]

In issue #97 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="319" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Nov. 1998</span>) of the second series titled <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="320" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Peter Parker: Spider-Man</span>,[79] Parker learns Norman Osborn kidnapped <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="321" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Aunt May</span> and her apparent death in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="322" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man</span> #400 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="323" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">April 1995</span>) had been a hoax.[80][81] Shortly afterward, in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="324" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man (vol. 2) #13</span> (#454, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="325" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Jan.</span> 2000), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="326" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane</span> is killed in an airplane explosion.[82] She is revealed to be alive in volume 2, issue #28 (#469, April 2001),[82] but she and Peter are completely separated in the following issue.[83]
Babylon 5 creator <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="327" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">J. Michael Straczynski</span> began writing <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="328" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man</span>, illustrated by <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="329" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">John Romita Jr., beginning with volume 2, #30 (#471, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="330" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">June 2001</span>). Two issues later, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="331" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Peter</span>, now employed as a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="332" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">teacher at his old high school</span>, meets the enigmatic <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="333" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ezekiel Sims</span>, who possesses similar spider powers and suggests that Peter, having gained such abilities, might not have been a fluke—that Parker has a connection to a totemic spider spirit.</span> In vol. 2, #37 (#478, Jan. 2002), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="334" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Aunt May</span> discovers her nephew is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="335" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>.[81] Peter and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="336" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane</span> reconcile in (vol. 2) #50 (#491, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="337" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">April 2003</span>),[81] and in #512 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="338" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Nov. 2004</span>)—the original issue numbering having returned with #500—Parker learns his late girlfriend <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="339" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Gwen Stacy</span> had had two children with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="340" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Norman Osborn</span>.[84]

He joins the superhero team the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="341" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">New Avengers</span> in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="342" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">New Avengers #1–2</span>. After a deranged, superpowered former high-school classmate destroys their respective homes, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="343" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="344" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="345" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">May</span> move into Stark Tower, and Peter begins <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="346" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">working as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="347" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Tony Stark</span>&#x27;s assistant</span> while <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="348" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">freelancing for The Daily Bugle</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="349" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">continuing his teacher career</span>. In the 12-part <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="350" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">2005</span> story arc &quot;The Other&quot;, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="351" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span> undergoes a transformation that evolves his powers. In the comic <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="352" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Civil War</span> #2 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="353" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">June 2006</span>), part of the company-wide crossover arc of that title, the U.S. government&#x27;s Superhuman Registration Act leads <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="354" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="355" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">reveal his true identity publicly</span>. A growing unease about the Registration Act prompts him to escape with May and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="356" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="357" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">joins the anti-registration underground</span>.
In issue #537 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="358" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Dec. 2006</span>), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="359" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Aunt May</span> is critically wounded from <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="360" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Wilson Fisk</span>&#x27;s sniper, and enters into a coma. Peter, desperate to save her, exhausts all possibilities and makes a pact with the demon-lord <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="361" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Mephisto</span>, who saves <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="362" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">May</span>&#x27;s life in exchange for Peter and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="363" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane</span> agreeing to have their marriage and all memory of it disappear. In this changed reality, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="364" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>&#x27;s identity is secret once again, and in #545 (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="365" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Jan. 2008</span>), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="366" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane</span> returns and is cold toward him. The controversial[85] <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="367" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">storyline &quot;One More Day&quot;</span> rolled back much of the fictional continuity at the behest of editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, who said, &quot;Peter being single is an intrinsic part of the very foundation of the world of Spider-Man&quot;.[85] It caused unusual public friction between Quesada and writer <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="368" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Straczynski</span>, who &quot;told Joe that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the [story] arc&quot;, but was talked out of doing so.[86] At issue with Straczynski&#x27;s climax to the arc, Quesada said, was
...that we didn&#x27;t receive the story and methodology to the resolution that we were all expecting. What made that very problematic is that we had <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="369" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">four writers and artists</span> well underway on [the sequel arc] &quot;Brand New Day&quot; that were expecting and needed &quot;One More Day&quot; to end in the way that we had all agreed it would. ... The fact that we had to ask for the story to move back to its original intent understandably made Joe upset and caused some major delays and page increases in the series. Also, the science that Joe was going to apply to the retcon of the marriage would have made over 30 years of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="370" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="371" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> books</span> worthless, because they never would have had happened. ...[I]t would have reset way too many things outside of the Spider-Man titles. We just couldn&#x27;t go there....[86]
In this new continuity, designed to have very limited repercussions throughout the remainder of the Marvel Universe, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="372" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Parker</span> returns to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="373" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">work at the Daily Bugle</span>, which has been renamed The DB under a new publisher.[87] He soon <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="374" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">switches to the alternative press paper The Front Line</span>.[88] J. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="375" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Jonah Jameson</span> becomes the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="376" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Mayor of New York City</span> in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="377" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">issue #591</span> (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="378" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">June 2008</span>).[84] Jonah&#x27;s estranged father, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="379" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">J. Jonah Jameson Sr</span>., marries <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="380" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">May</span> in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="381" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">issue #600</span> (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="382" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Sept. 2009</span>).[84][89]
During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; by shape-shifting extraterrestrials, the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="383" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Skrulls</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="384" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Norman Osborn</span> shoots and kills the Skrull queen <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="385" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Veranke</span>.[90] He leverages this widely publicized success, positioning himself as the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="386" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">new director of the S.H.I.E.L.D.-like paramilitary force H.A.M.M.E.R.</span> to advance his agenda,[90] while using his public image to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="387" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">start his own Dark Avengers</span>. Norman, by himself, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="388" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">leads the Dark Avengers</span> as the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="389" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Iron Patriot, a suit of armor fashioned by himself after Iron Man&#x27;s armor with Captain America&#x27;s colors</span>.[91]
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="390" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Harry</span> is approached by Norman with the offer of a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="391" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">job within the Dark Avengers</span>. It is later revealed that it is a ruse to coerce Harry into taking the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="392" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">American Son armor</span>, whom Norman had planned to kill, in order to increase public sympathy. When <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="393" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Harry</span> has the option of killing Norman, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="394" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> says to decapitate him, since <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="395" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Norman</span>&#x27;s healing factor may repair a blow to the head. Spider-Man also cautions <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="396" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Harry</span> that killing Norman will cause Harry to &quot;become the son Norman always wanted&quot;. Harry instead backs down, and turns away from his father forever.[92]
At <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="397" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Loki</span>&#x27;s suggestion, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="398" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Norman Osborn</span> creates a rationale to invade Asgard, claiming the world poses a national security threat. He is defeated, and ends up incarcerated in the Raft penitentiary.[93][94] A conflict between Spider-Man and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="399" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="400" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Doctor Octopus</span></span> over Osborn&#x27;s son ends when it is revealed the child&#x27;s father is Harry, who leaves town to raise him.[95] One of Doctor Octopus&#x27; Octobots swaps his and Spider-Man&#x27;s personality, causing <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="401" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span> to become trapped in the Doctor&#x27;s dying body, while he in turn claimed Peter&#x27;s life for himself. Though <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="402" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Peter</span> failed to reverse the change, he manages to establish a weak link with the Doctor&#x27;s mind, forcing him to relive all of his memories; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="403" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Otto understands Peter&#x27;s ideals of power and responsibility and swears to carry on with Peter&#x27;s life with dignity as a &quot;Superior&quot; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="404" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>.[96][97]

A portion of Peter survived in his original body in the form of a subconsciousness.[98] Later, realizing that he failed in his role as the &quot;Superior&quot; Spider-Man, Otto willingly allows Peter to reclaim his body in order to defeat <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="405" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Osborn</span> and save Anna Maria Marconi</span>, Otto&#x27;s love.[99] In the aftermath of these events, Peter began to amend the relationships damaged by Otto&#x27;s arrogance and negligence, both as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He additionally took up the reins of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="406" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Parker Industries</span>, a small company founded by Otto after leaving Horizon Labs.[100]
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="407" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Peter</span> soon learns a second person had been bitten by the radioactive spider, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="408" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Cindy Moon</span>.[101] <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="409" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="410" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">tracks her down and frees her from a bunker</span> owned by the late <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="411" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ezekiel Simms</span>.[102] Not long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt her own heroine identity as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="412" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Silk</span>,[103][104] Spider-Man encounters a contingent of spider-people from all over the Multiverse that banded together to fight the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="413" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Inheritors</span>, a group of psychic vampires who had begun to hunt down the spider-totems of other realities.[105] During a mission to gather more recruits in 2099, the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by an alternate version of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="414" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Otto Octavius</span>.[106] Together, they neutralize the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="415" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Inheritors</span>.
Peter then stops a nefarious plan put forward by the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="416" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Jackal</span>.[107] After <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="417" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">the</span> events of &quot;Go Down Swinging&quot;, Peter&#x27;s life was plagued with problems on both sides. As <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="418" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="419" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mayor Fisk</span> publicly supports him, condemning all other vigilantes in order to isolate him from his superhero peers. As <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="420" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Peter Parker</span>, his academic credentials were revoked after accusations of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation from <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="421" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Octavius</span>, resulting in Peter being <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="422" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">fired from the Daily Bugle</span>. Subsequently, Peter became romantically involved with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="423" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane</span>.[108] Briefly, Peter Parker and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="424" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Spider-</span>Man split into separate beings due to an accident involving the reverse-engineered Isotope Genome Accelerator. Peter eventually manages to reverse the process, and merges his two halves back together before the side-effects worsen and result in their death.[109]
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="425" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Kindred</span> uses the resurrected <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="426" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Sin-Eater</span>&#x27;s sins to possess <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="427" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Miles Morales</span>, Spider-Gwen, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="428" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Spider-Woman</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="429" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Anya Corazon</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="430" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Julia Carpenter</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="431" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Doctor Strange</span>, who manages to restrain a possessed <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="432" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Silk</span>, agrees to help Spider-Man. However, Peter dies when fighting Kindred. While dead, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="433" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span>&#x27;s consciousness remembers the fateful day of the start of One More Day; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="434" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Kindred</span> is willing to resurrect Peter.[110]
&quot;People often say glibly that Marvel succeeded by blending super hero adventure stories with soap opera. What <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="435" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lee and Ditko</span> actually did in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="436" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="437" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span></span> was to make the series an ongoing novelistic chronicle of the lead character&#x27;s life. Most super heroes had problems no more complex or relevant to their readers&#x27; lives than thwarting <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="438" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">this month&#x27;s bad guys</span>... Parker had far more serious concern in his life: coming to terms with the death of a loved one, falling in love for the first time, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="439" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">struggling to make a living</span>, and undergoing crises of conscience.&quot;
Sally Kempton for the Village Voice opined in 1965 that &quot;Spider-Man has a terrible identity problem, a marked inferiority complex, and a fear of women. He is antisocial, castration-ridden, racked with Oedipal guilt, and accident-prone ... [a] functioning neurotic&quot;.[50] Agonizing over his choices, always attempting to do right, he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who seem unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal.[112]

Cultural historian Bradford W. Wright notes:

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="440" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>&#x27;s plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect. In the first issue of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="441" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing Spider-Man</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="442" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="443" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">J. Jonah Jameson</span></span>, publisher of the Daily Bugle, launches an editorial campaign against the &quot;Spider-Man menace&quot;. The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider-Man and makes it impossible for him to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="444" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">earn any more money by performing</span>. Eventually, the bad press leads the authorities to brand him an outlaw. Ironically, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="445" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span> finally lands a job as a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="446" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">photographer for Jameson&#x27;s Daily Bugle</span>.[10]: 212 
The mid-1960s stories reflect the political tensions of the time; early 1960s Marvel stories often deal with the Cold War and communism.[10]: 220–223  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="447" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Wright</span> writes:
From his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="448" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people. Fittingly, then, his <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="449" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">comic book</span> also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of young people. In <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="450" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1968</span>, in the wake of actual militant student demonstrations at Columbia University, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="451" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter Parker</span> finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University.... Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="452" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">combat lawlessness as Spider-Man</span>. As a law-upholding liberal, he finds himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives.[10]: 234–235 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="453" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Peter Parker</span> has <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="454" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">superhuman spider-powers and abilities derived from mutations resulting from the bite of a radioactive spider</span>.[113] Since the original Lee-Ditko stories, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="455" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> has had the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="456" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">ability to cling to walls</span>. This has been speculated to be based on a distance-dependent interaction between his body and surfaces, known as the van der Waals force,[114] though in the 2002 <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="457" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> film, his hands and feet are lined with tiny clinging cilia in the manner of a real spider&#x27;s feet. Spider-Man&#x27;s other powers include <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="458" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">superhuman strength, speed, agility, and balance</span> and a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="459" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">precognitive sixth sense referred to as his &quot;spider-sense&quot;, which alerts him to danger</span>.[113]
Spider-Man has a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="460" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">healing factor that allows him to recover from injuries sustained during battle</span>.[115] In the aftermath of the 1989 &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; storyline, Spider-Man was said to have &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="461" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">superhuman recuperative abilities</span>&quot; that sped up his recovery from the exhaustion he suffered in defeating the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="462" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Tri-Sentinel</span>.[116]

The character was originally conceived by <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="463" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Stan Lee and Steve Ditko</span> as intellectually gifted, and later writers have depicted his intellect at genius level.[117] <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="464" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Academically brilliant, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="465" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span> has expertise in the fields of applied science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics.</span>
With his talents, he <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="466" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">sews his own costume to conceal his identity</span>, and he <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="467" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">constructs many devices</span> that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters that allow him to shoot webs, swing at high speeds throughout the city, and navigate and trap <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="468" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">his enemies</span> with his webs, additionally small electronic tracking devices called spider-tracers and a spider-signal as a flashlight and a warning beacon to criminals.[113] Thomas Fireheart&#x27;s scientists, world-renowned, are unable to replicate the fluid Parker created while in high school.[118]
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="469" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> has had a large range of supporting characters introduced in the comics that are essential in the issues and storylines that star him. After his parents died, Peter Parker was raised by his loving aunt, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="470" style="background-color:#C4E9E4;">May Parker</span>, and his uncle and father figure, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="471" style="background-color:#C4E9E4;">Ben Parker</span>. After Uncle Ben is murdered by a burglar, Aunt May is virtually Peter&#x27;s only family, and she and Peter are very close.[51]
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="472" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">J. Jonah Jameson</span> is the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="473" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">publisher of the Daily Bugle</span> and Peter Parker&#x27;s boss. A harsh critic of Spider-Man, he constantly features negative articles about the superhero in his newspaper. Despite his role as Jameson&#x27;s editor and confidant, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="474" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Robbie Robertson</span> is always depicted as a supporter of both Spider-Man and his alter ego Peter Parker.[53]
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="475" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Eugene &quot;Flash&quot; Thompson</span> is commonly depicted as Peter Parker&#x27;s high school tormentor and bully, who idolizes Spider-Man, but is unaware that Spider-Man is Peter Parker. Later, he becomes a friend of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="476" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span> and adopts his own superhero identity, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="477" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Agent Venom</span>, after merging with the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="478" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Venom symbiote</span>.[53] Meanwhile, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="479" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Harry Osborn</span>, son of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="480" style="background-color:#C4E9E4;">Norman Osborn</span>, is most commonly recognized as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="481" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span>&#x27;s best friend, although some versions depicted him as his rival.[55]
Writers and artists over the years have established a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="482" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">rogues gallery of supervillains</span> to face <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="483" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>, in comics and in other media. As with Spider-Man, the majority of the villains&#x27; powers originate with scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology, and many have animal-themed costumes or powers.[note 6] The following <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="484" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">Spider-Man villains</span> are listed in the ordering of their original chronological appearance:

   Indicates a group. 
Unlike most superheroes, Spider-Man does not have a single villain with whom he has come into conflict the most. Instead, he is often regarded as having <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="485" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">three archenemies</span>:[166]
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="486" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Peter Parker</span>&#x27;s romantic interests range between his first crush, fellow high-school student <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="487" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Liz Allan</span>,[53] to having his first date with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="488" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Betty Brant</span>,[175] secretary to the Daily Bugle newspaper publisher <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="489" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">J. Jonah Jameson</span>. After his breakup with Betty Brant, Peter eventually falls in love with his college girlfriend <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="490" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Gwen Stacy</span>,[55][58] daughter of New York City Police Department detective <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="491" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Captain George Stacy</span>, both of whom are later killed by supervillain enemies of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="492" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>.[63] <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="493" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane Watson</span> became Peter&#x27;s best friend and eventually his wife.[74] <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="494" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Felicia Hardy, the Black Cat</span>, is a reformed cat burglar who had been Spider-Man&#x27;s sole superhuman girlfriend and partner at one point.[70]
Over the course of the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="495" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">comics</span>, Peter Parker had several biological children across different continuities, usually with Mary Jane Watson, including <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="496" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="497" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Benjy Parker</span> from the MC2 universe, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="498" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Spiderling (Annie Parker)</span> from Earth-18119.[176][177]
Within the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="499" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Marvel Universe</span>, there exists a multiverse with many variations of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="500" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>.[178] An early character included in the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="501" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">1980s</span> is the fictional <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="502" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">anthropomorphic animal parody of Spider-Man as a pig</span> named <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="503" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Spider-Ham</span> (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="504" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter Porker</span>).[179] Many imprints of Spider-Men were created, like the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="505" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">futuristic version of Spider-Man</span> in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="506" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Marvel 2099</span> named <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="507" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Miguel O&#x27;Hara</span>. In the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="508" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Marvel Comics 2 imprint</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="509" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter</span> marries <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="510" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mary Jane</span> and has a daughter named <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="511" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Mayday Parker</span>, who <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="512" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">carries on Spider-Man&#x27;s legacy</span>, while <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="513" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Marvel Noir</span> has a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="514" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">1930s</span> version of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="515" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter Parker</span>.[178][180][181] Other themed versions exist within the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="516" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">early 2000s</span>, such as a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="517" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Marvel Mangaverse</span> version and an Indian version from <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="518" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Spider-Man: India</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="519" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Pavitr Prabhakar</span>.[178][182]
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="520" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Ultimate Spider-Man</span> was a popular modern retelling of Spider-Man, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="521" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Peter Parker</span>. The version of Peter Parker would later be <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="522" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">depicted as being killed off</span> and replaced by a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="523" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Black Hispanic Spider-Man</span> named <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="524" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Miles Morales</span>.[183]
The storyline &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; brought back many alternate takes on <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="525" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> and introduced many new ones, such as an alternate world where <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="526" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Gwen Stacy</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="527" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">gets bitten by a radioactive spider</span> instead, along with a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="528" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">British-themed version</span> named <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="529" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-UK</span>, who is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="530" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Billy Braddock</span> from the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="531" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Captain Britain Corps</span>.[180][184]
In The Creation of Spider-Man, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="532" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">comic book</span> writer-editor and historian <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="533" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Paul Kupperberg</span> calls the character&#x27;s superpowers &quot;nothing too original&quot;; what was original was that outside his secret identity, he was a &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="534" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="535" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">nerdy high school student</span></span>&quot;.[201]: 5  Going against typical superhero fare, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="536" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Spider-</span>Man included &quot;heavy doses of soap-opera and elements of melodrama&quot;. Kupperberg feels that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="537" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Lee and Ditko</span> had created something new in the world of comics: &quot;the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="538" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">flawed superhero with everyday problems</span>&quot;. This idea spawned a comics revolution.[201]: 6  The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel&#x27;s early 1960s comic books, such as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="539" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="540" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span></span>, The Incredible Hulk, The Fantastic Four, and The X-Men ushered in a new type of superhero, very different from the certain and all-powerful superheroes before them, and changed the public&#x27;s perception of them.[202] After the comics depicted a real address in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="541" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">May Parker</span>&#x27;s residence, its residents received many letters from children to the superhero.[185]
Spider-Man has become <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="542" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">one of the most recognizable fictional characters in the world</span>, and has been <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="543" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">used to sell toys, games, cereal, candy, soap, and many other products</span>.[203] He has been <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="544" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">used as the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="545" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">company mascot</span></span>. When Marvel became the first <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="546" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">comic</span> book company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991, The Wall Street Journal announced &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="547" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> is coming to Wall Street&quot;; the event was in turn promoted with an actor in a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="548" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Spider-Man costume</span> accompanying <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="549" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Stan Lee</span> to the Stock Exchange.[10]: 254  Since <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="550" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">1962</span>, hundreds of millions of comics featuring the character have been sold around the world.[204] Spider-Man is the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="551" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">world&#x27;s most profitable superhero</span>.[205][needs update] In 2014, global retail sales of licensed products related to Spider-Man reached approximately $1.3 billion.[206] Comparatively, this amount exceeds the global licensing revenue of Batman, Superman, and the Avengers combined.[205]
Spider-Man <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="552" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">joined the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1987 to 1998 as one of the balloon floats</span>,[207] designed by <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="553" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">John Romita Sr.,[208] one of the character&#x27;s signature artists.</span> A new, different Spider-Man balloon float also appeared from 2009 to 2014.[207]
When Marvel wanted to issue a story dealing with the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the company chose the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="554" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">December 2001</span> issue of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="555" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">The Amazing <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="556" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span></span>.[209] In 2006, Spider-Man garnered major media coverage with the revelation of the character&#x27;s secret identity,[210] an event detailed in a full-page story in the New York Post before the issue containing the story was even released.[211]
In 2008, Marvel announced plans to release a series of educational comics the following year in partnership with the United Nations, depicting Spider-Man <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="557" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">alongside the UN Peacekeeping Forces to highlight UN peacekeeping missions</span>.[212] A BusinessWeek article listed Spider-Man as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="558" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">one of the top 10 most intelligent fictional characters in American comics</span>.[213]
In 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, a case concerning royalties on a patent for an imitation web shooter. The opinion for the Court, by Justice Elena Kagan, included several <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="559" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> references, concluding with the statement that &quot;with great power, there must also come—great responsibility&quot;.[214]
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="560" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Spider-Man</span> has become a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="561" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">subject of scientific inquiry</span>. In 1987, researchers at Loyola University conducted a study into the utility of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="562" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Spider-Man comics</span> for <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="563" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">informing children and parents about issues relating to child abuse</span>.[215]
The culmination of nearly every superhero that came before him, Spider-Man is the hero of heroes. He&#x27;s got fun and cool powers, but not on the god-like level of Thor. He&#x27;s just <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="564" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">a normal guy with girlfriend problems and money issues,</span> so he&#x27;s more relatable than playboy billionaire Iron Man. And he&#x27;s an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="565" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">awkward teenager</span>, not a wizened adult like Captain America. Not too hot and not too cold, Spider-Man is just right.
In 2005, Bravo&#x27;s Ultimate Super Heroes, Vixens, and Villains TV series declared that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="566" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span> was the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="567" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">number 1 superhero</span>.[217] Empire magazine ranked him the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="568" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">fifth-greatest comic book character of all time</span>.[218] Wizard magazine placed Spider-Man as the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="569" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">third-greatest comic book character</span> on their website.[219] In 2011, Spider-Man placed <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="570" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">third on IGN&#x27;s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time</span>, behind DC Comics characters Superman and Batman,[216] and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="571" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">sixth in their 2012 list of</span> &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="572" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">The Top 50 Avengers</span>&quot;.[220] In 2014, IGN identified Spider-Man the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="573" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">greatest Marvel Comics character of all time</span>.[221] A 2015 poll at Comic Book Resources named Spider-Man the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="574" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">greatest Marvel character of all time</span>.[222] IGN described him as the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="575" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">common everyman that represents many normal people, but also noted his uniqueness compared to many superheroes with his depicted flaws as a superhero</span>. IGN wrote that despite being one of the most tragic superheroes of all time, he is &quot;one of the most fun and snarky superheroes in existence.&quot;[216] Empire praised <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="576" style="background-color:#E8EAED;">Spider-Man</span>&#x27;s always-present sense of humor and wisecracks in the face of the many tragedies he faces. The magazine website appraised the depiction of his &quot;<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="577" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">iconic&quot; superhero poses</span>, describing it as &quot;a top artist&#x27;s dream&quot;.[219]
George Marston of Newsarama called Spider-Man&#x27;s origin the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="578" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">greatest origin story of all time</span>, opining that &quot;Spider-Man&#x27;s origin combines all of the most classic aspects of pathos, tragedy and scientific wonder into the perfect blend for a superhero origin.&quot;[223]
In <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="579" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">2022</span>, Penguin Random House released a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="580" style="background-color:#DDE8E8;">Penguin Classics edition</span> of the first issues of Spider-Man as part of a line of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="581" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Penguin Classics</span> editions of other Marvel characters.[224]
