Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland

by Lewis Carroll

THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0

CHAPTER I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole


<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">was beginning to get very tired</span> of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">sitting by <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">her sister</span></span> on the
bank, and of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">having nothing to do</span>: once or twice she had peeped into
the book <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">her sister</span> was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, “and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
“without pictures or conversations</span>?”

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">feel very sleepy and stupid</span>), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">a White Rabbit</span> with pink eyes <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">ran
close by her</span>.

There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way</span> to hear <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the Rabbit</span> say to itself, “<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Oh
dear! Oh dear!</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I shall be late!”</span> (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Rabbit</span> actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">burning with curiosity</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">she ran across the
field after it</span>, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> after it, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.</span>

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
deep well.</span>

Either the well was very deep, or <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">she</span> fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">wonder what
was going to happen next</span>. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">to her great
disappointment it was empty</span>: she did not like to drop the jar <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">for fear
of killing somebody underneath</span>, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.

“Well!” thought <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">How brave they’ll all think me
at home!</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house</span>!” (Which was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Would the fall _never_ come to an end?</span> “<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I wonder how
many miles I’ve fallen by this time</span>?” <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">she</span> said aloud. “<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, I think</span>—” (for, you see, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> had learnt
several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but
then <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to</span>?” (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> had no
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
grand words to say.)

Presently <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">she</span> began again. “<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I wonder if I shall fall right _through_
the earth!</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward!</span> The Antipathies, I think—” (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">she</span> was rather
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">glad there _was_ no one listening</span>, this time, as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="41" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it didn’t sound at all
the right word</span>) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="42" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia</span>?”
(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re
falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="43" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">And what
an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking!</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="44" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">No, it’ll never do
to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere</span>.”

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="45" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> soon began
talking again. “<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="46" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="47" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Dinah</span>’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think</span>!”
(<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="48" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Dinah was the cat</span>.) “<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="49" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="50" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me!</span> There are
no mice in the air, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="51" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I’m afraid</span>, but you might catch a bat, and that’s
very like a mouse, you know. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="52" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">But do cats eat bats, I wonder</span>?” And here
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="53" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="54" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">began to get rather sleepy</span>, and went on saying to herself, in a
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="55" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">dreamy sort of way</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="56" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">“Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and
sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?”</span> for, you see, as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="57" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">she couldn’t answer
either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="58" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">She felt
that she was dozing off</span>, and had just begun to dream that she was
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="59" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">walking hand in hand with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="60" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Dinah</span></span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="61" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">saying to her very earnestly</span>,
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="62" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?”</span> when suddenly,
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="63" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">thump! thump!</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="64" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
the fall was over.</span>

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="65" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="66" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">was not a bit hurt</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="67" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">she jumped up on to her feet in a moment</span>:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="68" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">White Rabbit</span> was still in sight, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="69" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">hurrying down
it</span>. There was not a moment to be lost: away went <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="70" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> like the wind,
and was just in time to hear <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="71" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">it</span> say, as it turned a corner, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="72" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">“Oh my ears
and whiskers, how late it’s getting!”</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="73" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">She</span> was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="74" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Rabbit</span> was no longer to be seen: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="75" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">she</span> found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="76" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="77" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.</span>

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="78" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span>’s
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="79" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">alas!</span> either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="80" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">to her great delight it fitted!</span>

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="81" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="82" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">loveliest garden you ever saw</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="83" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">How she longed to get
out of that dark hall</span>, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought
poor <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="84" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span>, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="85" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!</span> I think I could, if I only
knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
happened lately, that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="86" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> had begun to think that very few things
indeed were really impossible.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="87" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">she</span> went
back to the table, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="88" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes</span>: this
time she found a little bottle on it, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="89" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">(“which certainly was not here
before,”</span> said <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="90" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span>,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="91" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="92" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="93" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">“No, I’ll look first,” <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="94" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">she</span> said,
“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not</span>”; for she had read
several nice little histories about <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="95" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">children who had got burnt, and
eaten up by wild beasts</span> and other unpleasant things, all because they
_would_ not remember the simple rules <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="96" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">their friends had taught them</span>:
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds; and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="97" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">she had never forgotten</span> that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.

However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="98" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Alice</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="99" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">ventured to
taste it</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="100" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">finding it very nice</span>, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
